# Goodbye Cruel World
Truthfully, this is just my initial blog post that I am testing Jekyll with, but while I'm at it: Can we stop using ```Hello World```?  I mean, I get it - it's the standard and it works and really, what would the point even be?  Well, there would be little point to it but after the past 12 months I think ```Hello darkness, my old friend``` or ```Goodbye cruel world``` is just a bit more 'with the times'.  Stay tuned for more poignant social commentary.
